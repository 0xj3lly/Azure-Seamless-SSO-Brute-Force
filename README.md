# Azure-Seamless-SSO-Brute-Force

A quick nasty brute forcer for seamless SSO written in powershell, initial POC modified from https://securecloud.blog/2019/12/26/reddit-thread-answer-azure-ad-autologon-endpoint/.

I'm terrible at PowerShell so theres likely to be bugs, feel free to submit pull requests.
